## Getting Started

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to our [Installation Guide](https://www.cursorlens.com/docs/getting-started/installation).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- pnpm
- PostgreSQL
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)

### Option 1: Running with Docker

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Set up environment variables
4. Set up the database with `pnpm prisma migrate dev`
5. Build the project with `pnpm build`
6. Set up ngrok
7. Configure Cursor to use your ngrok URL as the API endpoint

For full details on each step, please see the [Installation Guide](https://www.cursorlens.com/docs/getting-started/installation).

### Option 2: Running Locally

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-lens.git
cd cursor-lens
pnpm install
```

2. Copy the example environment file and configure it

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Set up the database

```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev
pnpm prisma db seed
```

4. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

5. In a separate terminal, start localtunnel

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```

### Configuration

1. Configure your `.env` file:

```plaintext
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres

# AI Provider Keys (at least one is required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

2. The tunnel URL will be displayed in the dashboard. Use this URL in Cursor's settings:
   - Open Cursor Settings
   - Search for "OpenAI Base URL"
   - Paste your tunnel URL
   - Save settings


## Usage

1. Configure Cursor to use Cursor Lens as its API endpoint by overriding `OpenAI Base URL`.
2. Choose a `gpt-` model. Use Cursor as normal for AI-assisted coding.
3. Visit the Cursor Lens dashboard to view logs, statistics, and insights.

## Stats page

## Prompt caching with Anthropic (v0.1.2):

1. Create a new config on `/configuration` page, choose `antropicCached` with Sonnet 3.5. Name it as you like.
2. Mark it as default.
3. Use Cursor with CursorLens as normal. The system and context messages in `CMD+L` and `CMD+i` chats will be cached from now on.

> Note that TTL for the cache is 5 minutes.
